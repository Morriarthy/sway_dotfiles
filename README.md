# sway_dotfiles

This repo includes my dotfiles for sway, which I used back in 2021 and I thought I lost.

I just found a backup of the dotfiles which I though was lost and also the reason why I use pictures instead of screenshots. ;-)


This is how it looked on my Chewi Notebook:

"Picture of my Chewi Infinitybook-X running sway")

First I created black borders, because I planed then a Black AND a White Theme:

"Picture of Sway still with the black border which was my 1st try.")

But then I decided to try something different than my usual "dark" stuff.
And I ended up with this bright white them which is pretty good to read:

"Picture of Sway with the rounded white border.")

I will add screenshots and more details later.
This is still WIP and I will try to reproduce my old Sway Theme.
